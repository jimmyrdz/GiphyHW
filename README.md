# GiphyHW

# Purpose:
The app starts off with preset animal button suggestions. The user can add more buttons to the page to include animals they like by using the search bar. A new button will appear for every animal searched by hitting the "submit" button. That new button will have the same function as the default buttons. When you click a button, 10 gifs will populate in a "still-state"... you can animate the gif only by clicking on the gif image. Pause it by clicking on it again. Gif ratings will also be displayed above the gif.
